# NYC-Arrests

In our project, we will be focusing on a dataset called NYPD arrest. Our goal is
to analyze the arrest dataset to determine the correlation between the type
of crime, borough, precise location, season, sex and age group of the
offenders. The purpose of this is to determine which type of crime is more
likely to occur during which time of the year, and which area of a borough.

For this project, we used the software tool called RStudio. Using RStudio, we
were able to preprocess the data by cleaning it, clustering, and converting data 
types. We were also able to analyze the dataset in terms of association rule 
mining using the apriori algorithm as well as visualize the dataset.

Through this we will be able to determine which areas in NYC are likely to
have a particular crime happen. This will allow us to know which location may
need to be improved with more security, during certain times of the year, in
order to prevent certain crimes from taking place.
